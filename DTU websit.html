            <article>
                Debre Tabor University (DTU) has introduced “innovation <br>
                curriculum” since its foundation innovative curriculum <br>
                is for problem solving, creative and imagination. Its <br>
                approach is student-counter that mikes the learner the <br>
                major player of the teaching and learning process. This <br>
                is a paradigm shift, a move from the traditional teacher-centered<br>
                to a new student-centered to a new student-centered approach.The <br>
                main features of the innovation curriculum are:It aligns course<br>
                / module objective to content method and assessment by incorporating <br>
                domains of education (knowledge, attitude, skill) and learning hierarchies <br>
                (simple to complex). tertiary education is complex learning. Complex learning <br>
                is problem solving, creative and imaginative thinking.<br>
                The curriculum has inbuilt monitoring system. This is a tool <br>
                which helps to evaluate the course/module level of compliance <br>
                to the above set guideline during preparation implementation and <br>
                assessment at the beginning middle and end of each semester <br>
                and every academic year. This is the way to address the Nation’s<br>
                 prevailing issue of education “Quality”.
